Excel PivotTables

- Goal is to go from a large data set into a smaller set to help see the data at a quick glance
- Drag field names into PivotTable Fields: "Filters", "Columns", "Rows" or "Values"
- Double click key data to show data set based on that information alone ex: click high sales number to be shown each sale made by a certain salesperson
- Create easy PivotChart by clicking into PivotTable > Analyze > PivotChart
- PivotChart vs Basic Excel Chart: PivotChart is connected to PivotTable, so any changes made to PivotTable will be changed on the PivorChart
